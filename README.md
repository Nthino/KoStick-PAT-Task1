📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the Practical Assessment Task (PAT) for the 2025 NC(V) Level 4 Computer Programming subject.

The task required identifying a real-world small business and designing a software solution using object-oriented programming principles.


🏪 Business Background

Business Name:Ko Stick

Special Feature: They make their own bread and write orders manually to track sales.


🔍 Identified Business Processes

### 1. Order Management
- Manual, handwritten order system
- Error-prone and delays during busy hours
- ➤ Solution: Develop a touchscreen digital ordering system

2. Stock Tracking
- Ingredients not automatically deducted
  No alerts when stock is low
- ➤ Solution: Build a live stock tracking form using VB.NET


 📐 Class Diagram (Task 1)

I extracted 3 key entities for the system:
- `Bread` – superclass for base price
- `Kota` – subclasses representing each kota type (inherit from Bread)
- `Order` – holds ordered items and total calculation

> ✅ Diagram created using Draw.io and included in this repo.
